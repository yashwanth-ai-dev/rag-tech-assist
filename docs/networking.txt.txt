NETWORKING ESSENTIALS

IP ADDRESSING
- IPv4 uses format x.x.x.x (0-255).
- Subnet mask determines the network and host portions.
- Default gateway is the router IP.
- Use "ipconfig" (Windows) or "ip a" (Linux) to view network info.

DNS BASICS
- DNS converts domain names (google.com) to IP addresses.
- If DNS fails, websites will not load, but pinging 8.8.8.8 might still work.
- Commands:
  - nslookup <domain>
  - ipconfig /flushdns
  - systemd-resolve --flush-caches

DHCP BASICS
- DHCP automatically assigns IP, subnet, and gateway.
- If DHCP is down, system gets APIPA (169.254.x.x).

TROUBLESHOOT SLOW OR NO INTERNET
1. Restart router.
2. Test with LAN cable.
3. Disable/enable adapter.
4. Update WiFi/LAN drivers.
5. Run "ipconfig /flushdns".
6. Reset TCP/IP:
   - netsh int ip reset
7. Check interference (WiFi channels 1/6/11).
8. Check background downloads.
9. Try safe mode with networking.

PING, TRACERT, NSLOOKUP
- ping tests connectivity.
- tracert traces routing path.
- nslookup checks DNS.

ROUTER CONFIG
- Access via 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.
- Change DNS to 8.8.8.8/1.1.1.1.
- Check router logs for disconnects.
- Update router firmware.

VPN BASICS
- VPN encrypts traffic and changes routing.
- VPN can slow internet drastically.
- Common fixes:
  - Change server region.
  - Disable split tunneling.
  - Switch protocol (WireGuard vs OpenVPN).

COMMON WIFI FIXES
- Reset network settings.
- Forget and reconnect to network.
- Change 5 GHz ↔ 2.4 GHz band.
- Disable power saving on WiFi adapter.

LINUX NETWORK FIXES
- Restart NetworkManager:
  - systemctl restart NetworkManager
- Check logs:
  - journalctl -u NetworkManager
